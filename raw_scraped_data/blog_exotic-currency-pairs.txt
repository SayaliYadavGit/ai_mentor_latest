The forex market is the biggest and most liquid market to trade. For traders, this represents an opportunity to benefit from changing currency prices. Major and minor pairs often take centre stage, but there is a third category that can provide trading opportunities. These are called exotic currency pairs.


 

Quick facts






Forex is traded in pairs, with the first currency as the "Base Currency" and the second as the "Quote Currency."
They can be classified as major, minor, and exotic pairs.

Major, Minor, and Exotic - What's The Difference?


 

In forex, currencies are always traded in pairs. Each forex trade involves the simultaneous buying of one currency while selling another. These currencies are quoted in pairs, with the first currency being the "base currency" and the second being the "quote currency."

For example, in the pair EUR/USD, EUR is the base currency, while USD is the quote currency.

The value of a currency pair represents the amount of the quote currency needed to buy one unit of the base currency.


 

Major Currency Pairs


The most heavily traded and widely recognized currencies in the world comprise major currency pairs.






They always include the US Dollar (USD) as one of the paired currencies.
* Major currency pairs represent the largest portion of forex trading volume, making up most market activity.
* These pairs tend to have high liquidity and tighter spreads and are popular among both retail and institutional traders.
* Examples include:



EUR/USD	Euro/US Dollar
USD/JPY	US Dollar/Japanese Yen
GBP/USD	British Pound/US Dollar
USD/CHF	US Dollar/Swiss Franc
USD/CAD	US Dollar/Canadian Dollar
AUD/USD	Australian Dollar/US Dollar



 

Minor Currency Pairs


 

Minor currency pairs, or crosses, represent currency pairs from major economies other than the US.






They don't involve the US Dollar (USD) as one of the paired currencies.
While they have lower trading volumes compared to major pairs, they are still relatively liquid and actively traded.
Examples include:



EUR/GBP	Euro/British Pound
EUR/JPY	Euro/Japanese Yen
GBP/JPY	British Pound/Japanese Yen
AUD/JPY	Australian Dollar/Japanese Yen
EUR/AUD	Euro/Australian Dollar
CAD/JPY	Canadian Dollar/Japanese Yen



 

Exotic Currency Pairs


 

Exotic currency pairs include one major currency paired with the currency of an emerging or smaller economy.






These pairs are less commonly traded and have lower liquidity compared to major and minor pairs.
Exotic pairs are associated with countries from regions like Asia, Africa, the Middle East, or South America.
They are characterised by higher bid-ask spreads and increased volatility.
Examples include:



USD/TRY	US Dollar/Turkish Lira
EUR/TRY	Euro/Turkish Lira
USD/ZAR	US Dollar/South African Rand
USD/THB	US Dollar/Thai Baht
USD/MXN	US Dollar/Mexican Peso
EUR/HUF	Euro/Hungarian Forint



 

What Are Exotic Currency Pairs?


 

Exotic pairs are less liquid and less commonly traded. They are made up of one major currency paired with the currency of an emerging or less-established economy.

Exotic currencies don't enjoy the high liquidity benefits of trading major forex pairs. However, they tend to experience higher price fluctuations, allowing traders to take advantage.


 

Examples of Exotic Currency Pairs


 

Unlike major pairs, which feature currencies of major economies like the USD, EUR, JPY and GBP, exotic pairs include currencies from more discrete regions.

Some examples include USD/TRY (US Dollar/Turkish Lira), EUR/TRY (Euro/Turkish Lira), and USD/ZAR (US Dollar/South African Rand).


 

What You Should Know Before You Start Trading


 

While exotic pairs represent a potentially lucrative opportunity, don't go in with your eyes closed. Understand the pros and cons of trading exotic pairs to make a well-informed trading decision.


 

Advantages Of Trading Exotic Pairs


 



Unique opportunities: Exotic pairs can offer unique trading opportunities that may not be available in major pairs. Geopolitical events, economic developments, or unexpected news in emerging economies can lead to substantial price movements.
Potential for high returns: The increased volatility in exotic pairs can lead to significant price swings, providing the potential for high returns on successful trades.
Portfolio diversification: Including exotic currency pairs in a diversified trading portfolio can serve as a risk management strategy. Further, these pairs can also offer an additional opportunity when major pairs show stagnant price movements.



 

Disadvantages Of Trading Exotic Pairs


 



Higher costs: The lower liquidity in exotic pairs results in wider spreads and higher transaction costs, which can eat into potential profits.
Increased risk: The higher volatility of exotic pairs can expose traders to magnified profit potential, but similarly, magnified risk or loss as well.
Limited market insight: Information and analysis on exotic currencies may be scarce compared to major pairs.
