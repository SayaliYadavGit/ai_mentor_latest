📅 05.05.2023 👤 N Razlozhki

When starting your forex trading journey (or any venture), it is imperative that you do thorough research before you even make your first real trade. Yes, there is something to be said for being too "book smart" and not having enough experience applying the theory that you have learned, but in our experience, if you are smart with what you learn and how you learn it, you can never be too prepared.

The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine by Michael Lewis

 

 

"The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine" by Michael Lewis provides an account of the events leading up to the 2008 financial crisis and the individuals who predicted and profited from the collapse of the housing market. Lewis offers an in-depth look into the world of subprime mortgage bonds, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), and credit default swaps (CDS) that fuelled the crisis. Through vivid storytelling and interviews with key players, the book uncovers the complex web of greed, deception, and flawed financial practices that contributed to the disaster. Lewis highlights the few individuals who recognized the impending crisis and took advantage of the market's vulnerability. "The Big Short" was adapted into a film starring Christian Bale and Brad Pitt, which is also worth a watch. Slightly different from the other books on our list in that you may not learn how to be a better forex trader from this book, but an in-depth knowledge of the 2008 financial crisis is essential for anyone going into the financial markets.

Irrational Exuberance by Robert Shiller

 

 

"Irrational Exuberance" by Robert Shiller examines the phenomenon of speculative asset bubbles in financial markets, with a particular focus on the stock market. Shiller explores the psychological and economic factors that contribute to irrational exuberance, where market participants become overly optimistic and drive prices beyond fundamental valuations. The book covers historical examples of speculative bubbles and their subsequent bursts, including the stock market crash of 1929 and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. Shiller also discusses the role of media, herd behaviour, and the influence of narratives in shaping market sentiment. By analysing the cyclical nature of market booms and busts, "Irrational Exuberance" provides a cautionary perspective on the dangers of unchecked optimism and therefore remains an insightful resource for forex traders, despite this book focusing primarily on the stock market.
