Africa's Top-10: Leading Companies by Market Capitalisation (2025)
📅 10.16.2025 👤 Steve Miley

In this article, we will be looking at the largest companies in Africa, ranked by market capitalisation. African economies are smaller than most leading countries, but they are growing at a record pace. A good knowledge of Africa’s largest companies can be vital for traders to gain an edge in the market.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: What Forex products does Hantec offer?

South Africa continues to dominate the list — eight of the ten companies are South African, with Morocco providing the remaining two. This reflects South Africa’s deeper capital markets, better-developed corporate governance, and the presence of large domestic pension and investment funds. Other regions, such as West Africa and North Africa beyond Morocco, remain under-represented due to smaller and less liquid exchanges, frequent currency devaluations that reduce USD-based valuations, and the dominance of state-owned or offshore-listed enterprises that do not appear in local rankings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: What account types does Hantec offer?

From a sector perspective, banks dominate the list, with wireless telecoms forming the second-largest sector. The strength of financial and telecom institutions shows where Africa’s scalable private-sector growth has concentrated — in finance and connectivity. Meanwhile, gold miners have risen sharply in the rankings as the gold price surged to record highs in 2024–25. Gold Fields and AngloGold Ashanti were the biggest movers, with AngloGold rising from outside the top ten in 2023 to a top-three position in 2025 as investor appetite for gold assets and strong cash flow lifted valuations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: What do I need to know about Forex?

To put things into perspective, the total market value of the Top 10 African companies is roughly $265–270 billion. In comparison, the Top 10 companies in the United States exceed $20 trillion, while China’s Top 10 stand around $6–7 trillion, highlighting the vast room for growth in African equity markets as economies expand and corporate governance deepens.

How do we define the largest?

It is important for us to establish how we are ranking these companies. Yes, we are ranking the largest companies, but what does this mean, and how can we measure this? We will use market capitalisation as our measure, which is the market value of a company’s outstanding shares. This is effectively the equity value of a company and can show the public’s opinion on a company’s overall value. Market capitalisation is calculated simply by multiplying the price of the company’s shares by the number of outstanding shares there are of that company. This market capitalisation value is important for investors to have knowledge of to make sound decisions when investing and trading.

Data from Datawrapper and CompaniesMarketCap.com as of October 2025.

These companies may not be as recognisable to the average person as the largest companies in other continents or countries. This can make it even more important for traders to gain background knowledge of them and establish an advantage over the competition.

1. Naspers (Internet / Media / Technology)

The largest company in Africa and a diversified internet, technology, and multimedia holding company that operates globally. Founded in 1915, Naspers dominated the South African market throughout the 20th century, being the largest holding company with major stakes in books, newspapers, and magazines. Through the 1980s and 1990s, it began to globalise and diversify its assets, helping it become the multinational holdings company it is today.

It now holds a majority stake in its investment subsidiary Prosus, which manages Naspers’ global internet interests, including payments, food delivery, and social-media platforms. Through Prosus, Naspers is one of the largest shareholders in Chinese tech giant Tencent but has been gradually reducing its stake to fund share buybacks.

Naspers also owns Africa’s largest publishing company, Media24, as well as South Africa’s biggest online retailer, Takealot. The group continues to support innovation through Naspers Foundry — its venture capital arm investing in South African start-ups focused on e-commerce, logistics, and digital finance. These diversified investments have helped Naspers maintain its position as Africa’s most valuable publicly traded company and one of the world’s top-400 by market capitalisation (October 2025).

This performance helped the company rise sharply in Africa’s rankings between 2023 and 2025. The company remains listed on the JSE, the Ghana Stock Exchange, and the NYSE. Its disciplined capital management, operational efficiency, and reduced debt profile have made it one of the standout performers among global miners this year.

Q: What Forex products does Hantec offer?

Risks & opportunities:
Currency volatility remains the biggest challenge for global investors, with sharp swings in the rand, naira, and other frontier currencies often offsetting local-market gains.
Regulatory and political risks vary widely: shifts in capital controls, spectrum licensing, and fiscal regimes can quickly alter earnings trajectories.
Liquidity and valuation constraints persist, as African equities generally trade with smaller free floats and wider bid–ask spreads than developed markets.
Structural opportunities remain compelling — from financial inclusion and mobile payments to renewable energy, logistics, and infrastructure projects — all underpinned by a growing urban and consumer base.

Diversification guidance:
Blend exposure across sectors: balance the relative stability of banks and telecoms with the cyclical upside of resource names like gold miners.
Diversify currency holdings: use ADRs or dual listings (NYSE, LSE) where possible to mitigate FX risk.
Use ETFs or Africa-focused funds as a liquid core allocation, then add selective direct equity positions for alpha.
Adopt a staggered entry strategy around earnings releases or macro events, and apply strict risk controls or FX hedges to manage volatility.
