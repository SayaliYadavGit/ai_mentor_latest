The 10 Largest Companies in Asia 
1. Saudi Aramco (Tadawul: 2222) 

Industry: Oil & Gas 
Notable Products/Services: Crude oil, natural gas, petrochemicals 

Saudi Aramco is the world’s largest oil producer and the backbone of Saudi Arabia’s economy. The company holds some of the world’s largest proven oil reserves, enabling it to produce crude oil at the lowest cost among major energy firms. Despite the push for renewable energy, oil remains a crucial resource, making Aramco a dominant player in global energy markets. The company has been widely criticised for its environmental impact and role in climate change, given its massive carbon emissions. Its close ties to the Saudi government also bring geopolitical scrutiny, particularly regarding OPEC’s oil production decisions. As a key stabiliser in global oil markets, Aramco's production levels directly affect global energy prices, influencing inflation and economic growth worldwide. While still focused on crude oil production, Aramco is investing in carbon capture technology and renewable energy projects, including hydrogen fuel and solar power. However, its transition toward sustainability remains slow compared to global energy trends.
