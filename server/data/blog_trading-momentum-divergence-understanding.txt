Trading Momentum Divergence: Understanding and Knowledge of How to Trade
📅 01.27.2023 👤 Steve Miley

Trading momentum divergence is a popular technique used by technical traders to identify potential price reversals in the financial markets and is also used by Forex traders. It involves comparing the movement of an asset's price (like a Forex pair) to that of a technical momentum indicator, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI). By analysing the difference between these two series (the price and the momentum indicator), traders can identify divergences, which can indicate that a trend may be losing momentum or even reversing.

What Is Momentum?

In trading, momentum refers to the rate of acceleration or deceleration of the price of an asset, such as Forex pairs, stocks, or indices, over a specified time period. Traders use momentum as a popular strategy in the financial markets to take advantage of these rapidly appreciating or declining prices. It is based on the premise that securities that have been performing well recently are more likely to continue performing well, while those that have been underperforming are likely to continue underperforming. This is because investors often chase returns and drive up the price of assets that have been appreciating while selling off assets that have been declining.

What Are Momentum Indicators?

Momentum traders typically use technical analysis to identify financial markets and assets with strong momentum. They often use momentum indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Stochastic Oscillator, Williams %R, and Rate of Change (ROC), to measure the speed and strength of a security's price movement.
 

These momentum indicators provide traders with valuable information about the trend of security, such as whether it is overbought or oversold, and can help traders identify potential turning points in the trend. For example, if a security has a high RSI, it may indicate that the security is overbought and that a price correction may be imminent. On the other hand, if a security has a low RSI, it may indicate that the security is oversold and that a price rebound may be in the offing. Based on the signals generated by these momentum indicators, momentum traders may take long positions in securities that are rising and short positions in those that are falling in the hopes of profiting from the continuation of these trends. However, it's important to note that momentum trading carries significant risks, as momentum can change quickly and without warning. Momentum traders must be prepared for rapid and large losses if the momentum of security shifts unexpectedly. Additionally, momentum trading can be subject to market manipulation, as large traders may artificially inflate the price of a security to trigger momentum buying, only to sell their own holdings for a profit. While momentum trading can be a lucrative strategy, it is important to understand the risks involved. As momentum indicators are only an indicator of the direction the price of an asset is moving, they should always be used in conjunction with other investment strategies and market analysis to maximise returns and minimise risks.

What is Trading Forex Divergence?

In the context of forex trading, trading divergence refers to a situation where the price of an asset and a technical indicator, such as an oscillator like the RSI, move in opposite directions. This discrepancy is seen as a potential signal of a trend reversal or continuation and can be used by forex traders to make investment decisions. There are two types of divergence: bullish and bearish.A bullish divergence occurs when the price of an asset makes lower lows while the indicator is making higher lows. This is seen as a potential signal that the trend is about to reverse from bearish to bullish.

Bearish divergence, on the other hand, occurs when the price is making higher highs while the indicator is making lower highs. This is seen as a potential signal that the trend is about to reverse from bullish to bearish.

 

It's also important to consider that divergence can be of two types, regular and hidden. Regular divergence is when the indicator and price move in opposite directions, as detailed above. Hidden divergence is when the indicator and price move in the same direction, but the indicator is making higher lows or lower highs.A hidden bearish divergence occurs when the price makes a lower high, but the oscillator makes a higher high, which occurs in a downtrend and indicates that the downtrend will continue.Hidden bullish divergence is seen in an up trend where the price makes a higher low, but the oscillator makes a lower low, and the expectation then is for the up trend to extend.

How to Trade Forex Divergence

To trade Forex divergence, one must first identify the divergence by finding a situation where the price of a Forex pair and a technical indicator move in opposite directions, signalling a potential trend reversal or continuation. The trader should then confirm the signal by using a combination of other technical analysis tools and strategies, such as support and resistance levels, trend lines, and candlestick patterns. This combination of techniques can provide a more complete picture of the market and increase the accuracy of the signals generated by trading divergence. Next, the trader must determine the direction of the trade. They will determine if the trend is reversing or continuing based on the signal from the divergence and the other technical analysis tools. It is important to note that while trading divergence can provide valuable information, it is not a guarantee of future price movements. Traders should always use proper risk management techniques, such as setting stop-loss and take-profit orders, to protect their investments. Additionally, traders should use trading divergence in combination with other analysis tools to make investment decisions, rather than relying solely on divergence signals, in order to properly manage risk.
