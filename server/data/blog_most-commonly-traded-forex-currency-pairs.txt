4 Most Commonly Traded Forex Currency Pairs in 2023
📅 01.16.2024 👤 N Razlozhki

Forex markets reflected much of the volatility that the global economy went through in 2023. Geopolitical conflicts, movements in the price of oil, and a short dollar rally towards the second half of the year have all had bearings on the ups and downs that currency markets saw last year.

From a top level, this has meant that investors flocked to gold, a safe haven asset in times of turbulence. A weaker dollar (despite its short rally) has also meant that certain major pairs concluded the year with decent gains.

Here's a look at the top 4 currency pairs that were most commonly traded in 2023.

XAUUSD

 

Gold is often considered a safe-haven asset, and investors tend to flock to it during times of economic uncertainty. Subsequently, gold prices had a volatile year, fluctuating in response to changes in the global economy and monetary policies. Prices initially rose due to economic uncertainty and inflation fears in early 2023.

However, as central banks around the world began increasing interest rates to combat inflation, gold prices fell. This is because gold does not offer a yield, and higher interest rates make other assets, like bonds, more attractive to investors.

Additionally, gold is also impacted by geopolitical events and changes in investor sentiment. For example, increased tensions between major economic powers can lead to a flight to safety, causing gold prices to rise.

As for its performance last year, gold still ended 2023 on an all-time high, proving to live up to its reputation as a safe haven.

 

EURUSD

 

The EURUSD currency pair had a mixed performance in 2023, reflecting the ups and downs of the European economic and political landscape. At the beginning of the year, the euro was bolstered by positive economic data coming out of the Eurozone.

This, coupled with the US dollar's weakness due to its own economic and political challenges, led to a strengthening of the euro against the dollar.

However, as the year progressed, political uncertainty in the Eurozone and a strengthening dollar caused the euro to weaken, although it did manage to regain some of the dips by the 2023 year-end.

 

USDJPY

 

In 2023, the price of oil was a major factor influencing the USDJPY currency pair. As oil prices rose throughout the year, the dollar gained strength, as it was the primary currency used for trading oil. This, in turn, contributed to the USDJPY currency pair's overall positive performance in 2023.

Additionally, the Bank of Japan's continued easy monetary policy and negative interest rates also played a role in the yen's weakness against the dollar. This created a disparity in interest rates between the two countries, making the dollar more attractive to traders.

 

GBPUSD

 

At the start of the year, the pound was already under pressure due to ongoing uncertainty. As the year progressed, new political developments, such as changes in the UK government and ongoing negotiations over trade agreements, added to the volatility of the currency. This led to fluctuations in the value of the pound and a decline in the GBPUSD currency pair.

As the year went on, GBP climbed to all-time highs by the month of July. However, pound weakness followed almost immediately in August and September as UK data disappointed, and the British economy contracted by more than any forecasted numbers.

At the same time, as the US dollar weakened throughout the year, this helped mitigate some of the downward pressure on the pound and contributed to a modest recovery in the GBPUSD currency pair towards the end of the year.

It's important to note that while dollar weakness can have an impact on other currencies, it is just one of many factors influencing currency markets.

Other factors, such as domestic, economic, and political developments, interest rate differentials, and geopolitical tensions, can all play a role in shaping currency movements.

For example, the US dollar's weakness was not universal across all currency pairs in 2023. While it weakened against the pound, it strengthened against other currencies, such as the Japanese yen, due to a range of factors, including the interest rate differential between the two countries.
