However, this increase in accessibility has also increased the risks that retail traders face today of trading with a scam broker. Forex trading scams have rocked this industry in recent years, leading to a crisis of trust.

Use this 20-point checklist to evaluate whether the broker you choose to trade with is safe... or a scam. This comprehensive guide will help you ask key questions you need to be asking when selecting a broker, so that you can trade with the safety that your broker is, indeed, reputable, established and secure.

Q: What account types does Hantec offer?

1. Regulatory Compliance

Verify that your broker is regulated by a recognised financial authority locally or globally. This regulation ensures that the broker operates within established guidelines and safeguards your investments. Check their registration number and cross-reference it with the regulator's website for confirmation. As part of the Hantec Group, Hantec Markets is proud to be a part of a brand that is regulated across the world, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, and Mauritius.

2. Reputation and Reviews

Researching the broker's reputation can give you insights into their reliability and trustworthiness. Look for online reviews on various platforms such as forums (Trustpilot as an example), social media, and trading websites. Be cautious of reviews that seem overly positive or negative, as they may be biased or manipulated.

3. Contact Information

A legitimate broker should provide clear and accessible contact information, including a physical address, a working phone number, and a responsive email. Avoid brokers with vague contact details or only a P.O. box, as this could indicate a lack of transparency or legitimacy.

4. Background and History

Investigate how long the broker has been in business and whether they have a presence in multiple locations. A longer track record and broader presence often indicate stability and reliability in the industry.

5. Client Funds Segregation

Reliable brokers hold client funds in segregated accounts. Ensure that your broker separates your funds from their operational funds in segregated accounts. This protects your funds in the event of the broker's insolvency or financial difficulties.

6. Account Security

Check if the broker uses strong encryption and security protocols to protect your personal and financial information. Be wary of brokers that allow clients to trade without or with minimal verification, as legitimate brokers will have stringent identity verification processes in place to safeguard your account from unauthorised access.

7. Trading Platform

The trading platform you trade on is your gateway to the markets, so it's essential to ensure that it is reputable and reliable. Test the platform for functionality and user-friendliness to ensure it meets your trading needs.
