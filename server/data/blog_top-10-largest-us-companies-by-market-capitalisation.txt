Why does market capitalisation matter?

There are multiple ways to measure the size of companies, ranging from their sales revenue to profits and even their number of employees or market share. For the purposes of this article, we will use market capitalisation as our measure. This is the market value of a publicly traded company’s outstanding shares, so calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the share price. Market capitalisation shows the equity value of a company and can be seen as a gauge of public opinion on a company’s value.

Most of these companies you will likely recognise and will consume many of their products and services. We can see that nine of these firms breach the one trillion-dollar mark, with NVIDIA breaking into the top spot on the back of surging AI demand.

1. NVIDIA (NVDA)

NVIDIA is a leader in the world of graphics processing units (GPUs), powering industries ranging from gaming to artificial intelligence. The company is at the forefront of visual interfaces, data processing and deep learning frameworks that drive advancements in machine learning and AI.

Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky, the California-headquartered company went public in 1999.

Another tech giant, Microsoft, is the second-largest company in the US. They develop and provide software and technological services, such as their computer operating system Windows, along with cloud solutions, the search engine Bing, and applications like Microsoft 365.

Q: What account types does Hantec offer?

Much like Apple, Microsoft has made multiple corporate acquisitions over the years in order to expand. Microsoft tends to have a slightly different approach, having purchased some much higher-valued companies, such as LinkedIn and Skype. These companies have then been run by Microsoft, continuing in the same markets, as opposed to being integrated into the product line like for Apple.

The current Microsoft headquarters is in Redmond, Washington, in the US, with the company being founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Steve Ballmer replaced the former CEO in 2000 and proceeded to expand the company towards a “devices and services” strategy. They produced their first personal computer in 2012 and even acquired Nokia’s devices and services division to produce their first mobile phone.

In 1985 power struggles between executives led Wozniak to step back and Jobs to resign, founding NeXT. This led to a rough period for Apple through the 1990s as they lost market share to Microsoft, nearing bankruptcy in 1997 when they purchased NeXT and brought Jobs back. Over the next few decades, Apple began to dominate, powered by the innovation of new products such as the iPod, iPhone, iMac, Apple Watch and its latest, the Apple Vision Pro.
