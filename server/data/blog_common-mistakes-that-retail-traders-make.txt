Forex trading offers the appeal of financial freedom, yet a significant majority of retail traders end up losing money.

Q: What Forex products does Hantec offer?

The 63% Statistic – What It Really Means

According to data from the UK Financial Conduct Authority, approximately 63% of retail traders lose money when trading forex and CFDs. This statistic isn't just a number; it reflects the harsh reality of trading where the odds are stacked against the uninformed and undisciplined.

5 Critical Mistakes Traders Make
Overleveraging: High leverage magnifies losses; new traders often overexpose themselves.
Lack of a Trading Plan: Trading without a plan leads to emotional and inconsistent decisions.
Poor Risk Management: Skipping stop-losses and risking too much per trade causes major losses.
Chasing the Market: Revenge trading typically results in a cycle of emotional loss.
Failure to Adapt: Static strategies fail in dynamic market conditions.
5 Other Important (but Overlooked) Mistakes
Neglecting Fundamental Analysis: Ignoring economic factors leads to blindsided trades.
Overtrading: Too many trades increase costs and exposure to noise.
Lack of Journaling and Review: Without documentation, mistakes are repeated.
Impatience and Unrealistic Expectations: Expecting fast profits leads to risky behavior.
Not Understanding Broker Terms: Fees and slippage can erode profits.
Psychology vs. Strategy: What Matters More?
