📅 04.19.2022 👤 N Razlozhki

The history of currency markets is a long and complex one, but it is fascinating nonetheless. Currency markets are a pivotal part of the global economy and have evolved over the years in order to meet the needs of traders and investors. Over the centuries, they have evolved into sophisticated financial exchanges that allow countries, corporations and individuals to buy and sell goods and services around the world.

Historic currency markets

Currency trading has been around for centuries and can be traced back to Biblical times! During the Middle Ages, banks were established and used to trade currency between Europe and parts of Asia. But it wasn't until the establishment of the Gold Standard that currency markets entered what can be referred to as the "modern era".

The Gold Standard

 

The Gold Standard was a monetary system in which the value of a currency was tied to the value of gold. Under this system, paper money can be exchanged for gold at a fixed rate. The exchange rate for any two currencies was calculated from the price of an ounce of gold between the two currencies.

 

However, by the beginning of World War I, the Gold Standard broke down as a monetary system, as large European nations printed money to pay for large military projects. The Gold Standard did reappear between the World Wars but was abandoned by 1939.

Bretton Woods

 

Members of the Allies met in 1944 at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, USA and agreed to fix exchange rates, with the US Dollar replacing gold as the primary reserve currency. The US Dollar became the benchmark for currency conversions, backed by gold.

 

The Bretton Woods system was successful until the early 1970s, by which time the US Treasury could not cover all the US Dollars held by overseas central banks with gold. The US President, Richard Nixon, closed the gold window on 15th August 1971. This meant the end of the ability to readily exchange the US Dollar for gold, which saw the end of the Bretton Woods agreement.

The Bretton Woods agreement was also effective because three global organisations were established.

 

The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (part of the World Bank).

The International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This later became the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

 

The Smithsonian Agreement

 

In the wake of the end of the Bretton Woods agreement, the Smithsonian Agreement was established in 1971, which pegged the US Dollar to gold at $38 per ounce, within trading bands of 2.25%. It was a short-lived attempt to stabilise currency exchange rates. The United States, which had long pegged the US Dollar to gold, agreed to raise the price of gold and allow other currencies to fluctuate relative to the US Dollar. The goal was to create a more stable international monetary system, but the agreement collapsed just a few months later when the US Dollar began to lose value. The failed agreement was a major factor in creating the modern floating exchange rate system. Despite its ultimate failure, the Smithsonian Agreement remains an important moment in economic history.

Q: What account types does Hantec offer?

The Plaza Accord

 

The Plaza Accord was an agreement between the United States and four other major economies - Japan, West Germany, France, and the United Kingdom - to devalue the US dollar in order to correct the growing US current account deficit. In addition, the aim was to assist in helping the US (and global) economy to recover from the early 1980s recession. It is named the Plaza Accord as it was agreed to at the Plaza Hotel in New York on September 22nd, 1985. The devaluation of the US Dollar made US exports more competitive and helped to reduce the trade deficit. The Plaza Accord was successful in its goal of reducing the US trade deficit, but it also had some unintended consequences. The most notable of these was the higher value of the Japanese Yen, which made Japanese exports more expensive, leading to a marked decline in Japanese economic growth. The Plaza Accord is a reminder that even well-intentioned agreements can sometimes have unexpected consequences.

Today's currency markets

 

Today's currency markets are constantly in flux, driven by a vast array of interconnected economic, political, and social factors. At the core of these markets is the concept of free-floating exchange rates, which allow currencies to fluctuate in response to shifts in supply and demand. This dynamic system is heavily influenced by developments at the global level, with external financial and geopolitical events such as sanctions, trade agreements, and changing interest rates exerting significant influence over individual currencies. Thanks to advances in technology and communication tools, however, it has become easier than ever for people to stay informed about trends in currency markets around the world. Today's modern era of currency trading has created exciting opportunities for traders at all levels - whether you are a professional investor or just starting out on your journey towards financial independence.
