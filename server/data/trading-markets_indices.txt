Indices CFD explained

Index CFDs (Contracts for Difference) allow traders to speculate on the price movements of stock indices without owning the underlying assets. This enables traders to potentially earn from both rising and falling markets.

With index CFDs, traders can access baskets of stocks within a single trade, allowing them to diversify their portfolio. Index CFDs are traded on margin, meaning only a fraction of the total trade value is required as a deposit.
