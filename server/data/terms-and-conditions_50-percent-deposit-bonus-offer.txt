Specific Terms

Eligible Clients meeting the above criteria are entitled to a 50% deposit bonus, subject to the constraints detailed herein (the “Bonus”)

The Bonus cannot be lost, withdrawn from Eligible Clients’ accounts or transferred between live trading accounts within Hantec.
The Bonus capped at a maximum of 10,000USD, irrespective of the New Funds amount.
Bonus will not be provided to Eligible Clients if the latter engages in any trading activities utilising the New Funds prior to the crediting of the Bonus. Any trading activities undertaken before the Bonus is credited may not be taken into consideration and/or will result in the withholding of the Bonus by Hantec and disqualification of Eligible Clients.
By participating in this promotion, Eligible Clients agree that the automatic liquidation level or stop-out level for the trading account to which the 50DBO is applied is set at an equity stop-out level equal to the Bonus amount, instead of a percentage stop out level.
